# openSourceSchool Manifesto

In an effort to develop software excelling in usability, design, and architecture, the following principles will be adhered to strictly during development:

## Code

### Reusability

In order to ensure that the software can be repurposed and customized, it is essential that the code is reusable. To achieve this, we will utilize a module software development style, ensuring that each component of the software can be utilized by itself.

In addition, rather than creating new standards and frameworks for development, we will utilize existing tools and software, and modify it and repurpose it as per the needs of educational institutions.

### Consistency

In order to ensure that our code is simple to understand and contribute to, we will follow a few specific guidelines:

- Our code will be well commented, ensuring that each and every module is justified in terms of its usage and relation to the rest of the application
- Our work in each language will follow a certain style guide:
