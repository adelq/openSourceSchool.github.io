# openSourceSchool Manifesto

In an effort to develop software excelling in usability, design, and architecture, the following principles will be adhered to strictly during development:

## Code

### Reusability

In order to ensure that the software can be repurposed and customized, it is essential that the code is reusable. To achieve this, we will utilize a module software development style, ensuring that each component of the software can be utilized by itself.

In addition, rather than creating new standards and frameworks for development, we will utilize existing tools and software, and modify it and repurpose it as per the needs of educational institutions.

### Consistency

In order to ensure that our code is simple to understand and contribute to, we will follow a few specific guidelines:

- Our code will be well commented, ensuring that each and every module is justified in terms of its usage and relation to the rest of the application
- Our work in each language will follow a certain style guide:
	- JavaScript: [AirBnB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

### Documentation

In order to ensure that in addition to developers, the end-user of our products can understand how to use them, we will properly document every component we create, adhering to the following standards:

- The documentation will be done in a format that can be repurposed and reformatted by others
	- it will be plaintext, in a Markdown format
	- in order to provide a formatted version of our own, we will utilize [Raneto](http://raneto.com), software which will create a static knowledgebase from Markdown files

## Design

### Aesthetic

To create a design that creates a desirable user experience for all parties involved, trends (flat design vs. skeuomorphic) will not be adhered to. Instead, we will choose to utilize a fairly minimalist aesthetic, prioritizing content and functionality over superficial aesthetic elements. Factors such as color scheme and imagery will be modifiable by the educational institution, based on their preferences and brand.

### User Experience

In order to ensure that all of our software has a consistent user experience, we will follow certain design patterns throughout development. We will utilize skeuomorphism where we need to create functionality that emulates physical elements, such as buttons. At the same time, we will adhere to a minimal experience, so that our interfaces are not overwhelming to users.

We will also work in a feedback-oriented manner, soliciting feedback from users in order to iteratively push changes that will enhance the experience while remaining consistent with what the user is used to doing.
